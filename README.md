Solidus Wallet Backport
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio-contrib/solidus_wallet_backport.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio-contrib/solidus_wallet_backport)

This is an extraction of the Spree::Wallet and "Non credit card payment sources"
features from Solidus 2.2, to be used on previous Solidus versions.

This adds support for payment sources other than CreditCard, which can be used
to better represent other (potentially reusable) payment sources, like PayPal or
Bank accounts. Previously sources like this had to implement all behaviour
themselves, or try their best to quack like a credit card.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_wallet_backport to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_wallet_backport'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_wallet_backport:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building
the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and
[Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy
app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use its
factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_wallet_backport/factories'
```
